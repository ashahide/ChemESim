# ChemESim
ChemESim is an open source chemical engineering simulator being developed in my spare time. The goal is to provide undergraduate and graduate students with robust, well-documented code that can be used to solve problems in courses such as process control and reaction kinetics. I plan to include youtube videos and worked examples explaining how to use the code, as well as videos where I narrate as I code different sections to introduce students to concepts in Python coding. If you wish to collaborate or have discovered a bug, please email me at ashahide@hawk.iit.edu.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I will keep a running citation in each folder based on code that I have used from different internet sources. Thank you to everyone who has shared community code that is being used to make ChemESim possible.
